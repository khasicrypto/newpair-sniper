# Welcome to Dr. Furr's Sniper Bot. Join the community: https://t.me/drfurrbots.

# All the variables possible values are explained below, PLEASE SET THE CORRECT VALUES OR ELSE THE BOT WON'T WORK. 

BETA. NOT FULLY TESTED.

# GENERAL SETTINGS:

`PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key is self explanatory. No one will **ever** ask for it. Don't **share** it.

`TOKEN` = Contract of token you want to snipe.

`TOKEN_DECIMALS` = Token decimals from token contract on bscscan.

`PURCHASE_AMOUNT` = Amount of WBNB to use for each transaction.

`GAS_PRICE` = Fees price used for snipe for listings from dxsale, approve, instant buy and selling.

`GAS_LIMIT` = Fees price used for snipe for listings from dxsale, approve, instant buy and selling.

`MULTIPLY_GAS` = it will multiply the gas fees from the liquidity transaction to get in first block. 

`INSTANT_SELL` = Sell instant after buy/snipe? **(true/false)**.

`SELL_DELAY` = Set a delay in seconds for the bot to instant sell after buy confirmation, if you want instant put 0.

`ANTI_BOT` = Snipe antibot token (meaning you put less WBNB to buy with and do more transactions fast to gather more token).

`TRANSACTIONS_NUM` = If you have AntiBot set to **true** then it will automatically do X number of buy transactions.

`ANTI_RUG` = If you have **ANTI_RUG** set true and **INSTANT_SELL** is false then after snipe the bot will wait for RugPull. If it detects one it will immediately sell all tokens before RugPull.

`PRICE_CHECK` = If you have PRICE_CHECK set true then it will automatically check if the liquidity added is equal or higher than LIQUIDITY_BNB. 

`LIQUIDITY_BNB` = Please set less than the expected liquidity for example if you expect to have 100 bnb liquidity use 50 bnb, also use only int numbers with no decimals **(ex: 1, 2, 3, 100)**.
